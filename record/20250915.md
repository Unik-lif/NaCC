## 实验记录
调研结束，按照下面的步骤做逐步的实现
- 在task_struct中加入新的载荷


```
    /* 
     * Nacc Process Windows contains two checks:
     * - Check whether the current task is confidential task 
     * - Check whether the next task is confidential task 
     * 
     * Case 0: two regular tasks (nacc_flag == 0)
     *    -> do nothing
     * Case 1: current task is nacc task, next task is regular task
     *    -> trap to sbi, make sure the current task is nacc task, and later modify nacc_state to 'in_active'
     * Case 2: current task is regular task, next task is nacc task
     *    -> trap to sbi, make sure the next task is nacc task, and later modify nacc_state to 'linux'
     * Case 3: two nacc tasks
     *    -> trap to sbi, have a check, if these two are all nacc tasks, do nothing
     */

```

这一部分代码已经实现了，现在考虑agent这边怎么回去到我们的user app进程去
